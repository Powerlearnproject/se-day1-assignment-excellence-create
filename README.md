Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the science and art of designing, building, and maintaining software solutions that solve real-world problems.
software engineering is important in our world today for creating applications for the end users solutions, a software engineer doesn't only focus on codes alone rather
a software engineer focuses more how do i solve problems, what are the easiest way a problem can be dealt with and tackled.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. our applications today like instagram, facebook etc. that eases off people's social life.
2. it has helped in easy communication to distant friends, family and relations
3. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. idea generation: this is the basics where an idea comes up but it must be put down on a paper.
2. requirement analysis: this is where you analyse what does it require for me to solve a problem.
3. product design: this is the process of designing your idea on how it should look like, the mpop-ups and co.
4. product development: this is where you focus on the real coding, actualizing your design into a software.
5. integration and testing: this is the process of checking whether the product match the requirement
6. deployment: this is process of throwing out your software product for end users.
7. maintenace: this is the process of bettering the quality of your software product.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is a fun way of talking or giving instructions to the AI.
the way AI works is that it needs to be fed with a lot of data, after that you provide algorithms for it to be able to understand the data. and finally
models it helps AI to make decisions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
